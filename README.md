# FizzBuzz
In search of nice FizzBuzz implementation...

## What is FizzBuzz?
Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz):
> Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

The game is used during some programming job interviews to disqualify people who cannot even write an easy code.

## but... why?
FizzBuzz became a meme in a part of programming society. Programmers started looking for a *nice implementation* what succeeded in creating many funny solutions - from esoteric languages to deep learning. Hence, this repo has been created to store some some of them.
